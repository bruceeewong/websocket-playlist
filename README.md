Really easy and fun chatroom demo using websocket by NodeJS & Socket.io.

## How to play with it

clone code to your local directory, and install nodejs & npm;

then under root dir and run command on shell

```
npm install # install dependencies

npm run dev  # launch the express server
```

after that, type `localhost:4000` into your browser and u will see the chatroom page.

open two or more pages if you like, and see what it can do~
